# TxGNN: Zero-shot prediction of therapeutic use with geometric deep learning and human centered design

This repository hosts the official implementation of TxGNN, a model for identifying therapeutic opportunities for diseases with limited treatment options and minimal molecular understanding that leverages recent advances in geometric deep learning and human-centered. 

TxGNN is a graph neural network pre-trained on a comprehensive knowledge graph of 17,080 clinically-recognized diseases and 7,957 therapeutic candidates. The model can process various therapeutic tasks, such as indication and contraindication prediction, in a unified formulation. Once trained, we show that TxGNN can perform zero-shot inference on new diseases without additional parameters or fine-tuning on ground truth labels.

### Installation 

```bash
conda create --name txgnn_env python=3.8
conda activate txgnn_env
# Install PyTorch via https://pytorch.org/ with your CUDA versions
conda install -c dglteam dgl-cuda{$CUDA_VERSION}==0.5.2 # checkout https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html for more info, as long as it is DGL 0.5.2
pip install TxGNN
```

Note that if you want to use disease-area split, you should also install PyG following [this instruction](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) since some legacy data processing code uses PyG utility functions.

### Core API Interface
Using the API, you can (1) reproduce the results in our paper and (2) train TxGNN on your own drug repurposing dataset using a few lines of code, and also generate graph explanations. 

```python
from txgnn import TxData, TxGNN, TxEval

# Download/load knowledge graph dataset
TxData = TxData(data_folder_path = './data')
TxData.prepare_split(split = 'complex_disease', seed = 42)
TxGNN = TxGNN(data = TxData, 
              weight_bias_track = False,
              proj_name = 'TxGNN', # wandb project name
              exp_name = 'TxGNN', # wandb experiment name
              device = 'cuda:0' # define your cuda device
              )

# Initialize a new model
TxGNN.model_initialize(n_hid = 100, # number of hidden dimensions
                      n_inp = 100, # number of input dimensions
                      n_out = 100, # number of output dimensions
                      proto = True, # whether to use metric learning module
                      proto_num = 3, # number of similar diseases to retrieve for augmentation
                      attention = False, # use attention layer (if use graph XAI, we turn this to false)
                      sim_measure = 'all_nodes_profile', # disease signature, choose from ['all_nodes_profile', 'protein_profile', 'protein_random_walk']
                      agg_measure = 'rarity', # how to aggregate sim disease emb with target disease emb, choose from ['rarity', 'avg']
                      num_walks = 200, # for protein_random_walk sim_measure, define number of sampled walks
                      path_length = 2 # for protein_random_walk sim_measure, define path length
                      )

```

Instead of initializing a new model, you can also load a saved model:

```python
TxGNN.load_pretrained('./model_ckpt')
```

To do pre-training using link prediction for all edge types, you can type:

```python
TxGNN.pretrain(n_epoch = 2, 
               learning_rate = 1e-3,
               batch_size = 1024, 
               train_print_per_n = 20)
```

Lastly, to do finetuning on drug-disease relation with metric learning, you can type:

```python
TxGNN.finetune(n_epoch = 500, 
               learning_rate = 5e-4,
               train_print_per_n = 5,
               valid_per_n = 20,
               save_name = finetune_result_path)
```

To save the trained model, you can type:

```python
TxGNN.save_model('./model_ckpt')
```

To evaluate the model on the entire test set using disease-centric evaluation, you can type:

```python
from txgnn import TxEval
TxEval = TxEval(model = TxGNN)
result = TxEval.eval_disease_centric(disease_idxs = 'test_set', 
                                     show_plot = False, 
                                     verbose = True, 
                                     save_result = True,
                                     return_raw = False,
                                     save_name = 'SAVE_PATH')

```

If you want to look at specific disease, you can also do:

```python
result = TxEval.eval_disease_centric(disease_idxs = [9907.0, 12787.0], 
                                     relation = 'indication', 
                                     save_result = False)
```


After training a satisfying link prediction model, we can also train graph XAI model by:

```python
TxGNN.train_graphmask(relation = 'indication',
                      learning_rate = 3e-4,
                      allowance = 0.005,
                      epochs_per_layer = 3,
                      penalty_scaling = 1,
                      valid_per_n = 20)
```

You can retrieve and save the graph XAI gates (whether or not an edge is important) into a pkl file located as `SAVED_PATH/'graphmask_output_RELATION.pkl'`:

```python
gates = TxGNN.retrieve_save_gates('SAVED_PATH')
```

Of course, you can save and load graphmask model as well via:

```python
TxGNN.save_graphmask_model('./graphmask_model_ckpt')
TxGNN.load_pretrained_graphmask('./graphmask_model_ckpt')

```

### Splits

There are numerous splits prepared in TxGNN. You can switch among them in the `TxData.prepare_split(split = 'XXX', seed = 42)` function.

- `complex_disease` is the systematic split in the paper, where we first sample a set of diseases and then move all of their treatments to test set such that these diseases have zero treatments in training.
- Disease area split first obtains a set of diseases in a disease area using disease ontology and move all of their treatments to the test set and then further removes a fraction of local neighborhood around these diseases to simulate the lack of molecular mechanism characterization of these diseases. There are five disease areas: `cell_proliferation`, `mental_health`, `cardiovascular`, `anemia`, `adrenal_gland`
- `random` is namely random splits which it randomly shuffles across drug-disease pairs. In the end, most of diseases have seen some treatments in the training set.

During deployment, when evaluate a specific disease, you may want to just mask this disease and use all of the other diseases. In this case, you can use `TxData.prepare_split(split = 'disease_eval', disease_eval_idx = 'XX')` where `disease_eval_idx` is the index of the disease of interest. 

Another setting is to train the entire network without any disease masking. You can do that via `split = 'full_graph'`. This will automatically use 95% of data for training and 5% for validation set calculation to do early stopping. No test set is used.
